# AI Infra Lab

Experiments and directions for AI infrastructure. Agent infra, scheduling, cost-aware systems, evaluation pipelines. Work in progress.

## Roadmap

- **Agent infra experiments** — orchestration, tool use, memory
- **Scheduling ideas** — batch vs interactive, priority queuing, resource allocation
- **Cost-aware AI infra** — token budgets, model routing, caching strategies
- **Evaluation pipelines** — regression testing for LLM outputs, quality gates

## Current focus

Exploring production patterns for LLM-backed systems. Traditional infra playbooks do not map 1:1. Latency is variable. Cost scales with tokens. Quality is non-deterministic. This repo captures notes and experiments.
